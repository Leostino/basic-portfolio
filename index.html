                Eight years ago I left a career as a mental health therapist-in-training
                and returned to my first love—writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With the internet explosion (particularly the rise of the blogger), 
                 I was able to find opportunities to make this career shift. 
                 And now I am doing what I’ve dreamed of doing—being my own boss, working from home, 
                 doing what I love to do for a living!
                </p>
                <p>
                This started back in the summer of 2012 when I left a staff writing job and 
                became a fully independent web writer and blogger. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Since making that move, I’ve worked with many different clients to help them grasp the branding 
                and marketing power of blogging. I have seen companies and sole proprietors’ reach a wider 
                audience and meet their business goals with my blogging and content marketing tips.
